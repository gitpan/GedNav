IMPORTANT NOTES

As for additional features:  tell me what you want...

The GedNav pod section will be the main documentation, but it's not
really there yet...  :)

DESCRIPTION

This is the alpha release 0.01 of the GedNav module.

REQUIREMENTS

GedNav was developed using Perl 5.005_03.  Maybe it'll work with older
versions.  Maybe not.

It is written only in Perl, with standard distribution modules, so you
don't need any compiler nor special modules.
